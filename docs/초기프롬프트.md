# Role
You are a Senior Android Developer expert in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Clean Architecture.

# Project Goal
Create a "Simple Focus Timer" Android application.

# Tech Stack & Guidelines (Strict Adherence)
1. Language: Kotlin
2. UI: Jetpack Compose (Material3)
3. Architecture: Clean Architecture (Presentation, Domain, Data layers) + MVVM pattern.
4. Dependency Injection: **Koin** (Use Koin annotations or modules strictly).
5. State Management: Kotlin Coroutines & StateFlow.
6. Local Storage: Room Database (for saving focus history).

# Key Features
1. A circular timer UI that counts down (e.g., 25 minutes).
2. Start/Pause/Stop functionality.
3. Simple history list showing completed focus sessions.

# Task 1: Architectural Planning
Before writing any code, please analyze this request and provide a detailed **Folder Structure** and a **List of Koin Modules** you plan to create. Explain how you will separate the Domain layer from the Data layer.
